Summary

This APP uses Coord API, which is a bike share API mostly based in Washington and NY. I modified and added the Biketown API data via the Coord API. The Coord API is able to pull in real time available bikes to rent and locations.

This API was specifically designed for Portland, OR since Biketown is a regional bike share system here in Portland. You can modify the code for your specific market.

Google maps is used as the mapping tool utilizing its marker functionality. When a marker is hovered over it will display bike station name and the number of bikes available.

HTML is used for the page content and instructions
CSS is used for page styling and responsiveness.
JavaScript is used for button listning and AJAX is used to pull data from the Coord API and Google Map.
